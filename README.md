# ChooseLife-website
A website to help people to find nurses near to their locality by immediately connecting them to the nearest independent help to cater to their needs.

## Introduction 
The primary Goal of our project is to develop a website where professional nurses will register themselves and patients will approach them when they will have 
their need.<br>
There are three users: Admin , Nurse and Patient <br>
**Admin** will be responsible for managing and handling the entire system . It will be admin's authority to manage new registrations and logins of patient and nurse into the system and verify whether all users are genuine. <br>
**Patient** are required to register themselves first in order to access the data of the nurses. Once they login they can access the nurses's data.<br>
**Nurses** are required to register themselves with their identification number given to them by their respective state nursing council. <br>
